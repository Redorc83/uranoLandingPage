              Future modules or digital services integrated into the Urano

              requirements. Such checks will be conducted in accordance with
              GDPR, EU AML directives (including Directive (EU) 2015/849 and its
              amendments), FATF recommendations, MiCA (Regulation (EU) 2023/1114),
              and Regulation (EU) 2023/1113 (TFR – Transfer of Funds Regulation),
              as applicable. Each new service will be governed by specific terms,
              which Users must review and accept before accessing the
              functionality.
